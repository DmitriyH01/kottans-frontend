<p>Probably, this point in the assignment - "share impressions" made me think the most. For me, the field of programming itself is a novelty, learning Linux was easier for me, since I already got acquainted with GitBash before. One thing I can say for sure, I like this material, I will continue to take this course.</p>
<p>And most importantly - a big human thanks to those people who worked on the creation of this course, thank you for giving people the opportunity to learn something new and in demand in our modern world.</p>

<p>Well, here's the third point of the Front-end course passed. With each step it becomes easier to understand and assimilate the material, at least for now :) It was easier to go through this step, as I had already practiced before in try.github.io. Well, by tradition:</p>

<p>Now I have a general understanding of what HTML and CSS are. I learned the basics of two languages, it became clearer how what I see in my browser works. Now I can make a simple site, make some decoration in it. I know what selectors and classes are. In a word, I'm on my way to something big and very interesting.</p>

## Responsive Web Design

<p>So I came to something bigger and more interesting =)) The tasks became more complicated, the material was more voluminous, the simplest was the task with the frogs =)) One thing I can say for sure - CSS is still that bottomless barrel with a bunch of different properties and values, it's not crazy How long will it take to remember at least half of them? In the meantime, Google will help you (there are so many new bookmarks in the browser with interesting and useful information, how to find the time to read everything at least once). In fact, I learned what optimization and media queries are, tasted everything =)) I move on keeping a positive attitude.</p>
